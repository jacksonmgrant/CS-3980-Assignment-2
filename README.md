 Assignment 2: API, JSON, HTML, JavaScript

For this assignment, I used an html table to display the population data. I populated the table with a script that runs as soon as the html file is loaded. The script uses JavaScript's built in fetch call to make the API call to the [database](https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population), then builds the table body in a for each loop using JavaScript methods to add elements to it. Bootstrap was used for the table formatting, with some additional CSS to center the elements on the page.
