 Assignment 2: API, JSON, HTML, JavaScript

For this assignment, I used an html table to display the population data. I populated the table with a script that runs as soon as the html file is loaded. The script uses JavaScript's built in fetch call to make the API call to the database, then builds the table body in a for each loop using JavaScript methods to add elements to it.
